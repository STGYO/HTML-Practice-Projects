    <h1>Hello! My name is Srimoy  Trivedy</h1>
<p>
    This  is the first topic of my HTML Coding Journey.<br>
    I have just learned HTML and I think that it is very interesting.<br>
    So, I have challenged myself to complete 50 questions of each tier ranging from Basic, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert.<br>
    I hope that I will excel in all the questions that I have gotten from ChatGPT<br>
    I am publishing this project on GitHub for everyone to see and evaluate my progress.<br>
    If I have made any mistake or anyone watching this can suggest me any changes that would make the project better, please feel free to contact me.<br>
    Plz don't  mind the image. I randomly chose a picture from my Images Directory.<br>
